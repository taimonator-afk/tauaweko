Rangitāmiro – Claude Artifact Prototype Part of the Te Reo Makitaunu (TRM) Programme

🌿 Overview Rangitāmiro is a bilingual (Te Reo Māori + English) interactive resource created within Claude AI’s Artifact system, adapted for the Te Reo Makitaunu (TRM) learning ecosystem. It is designed to demonstrate AI-assisted presentation and interactivity while maintaining TRM’s kaupapa, visual style, and pedagogical structure.

This build has been exported as a .tsx file from Claude and can be deployed as a static HTML app for use within Systeme.io, GitHub Pages, or other TRM-approved learning environments.

🧩 Features 🪶 Bilingual interface (Te Reo Māori + English) 💡 Built with TypeScript + React (.tsx) 🎨 TRM-styled visual presentation (fonts, colours, and icons) 📱 Responsive layout for desktop and mobile 🔗 Easily deployable on GitHub Pages or within Systeme.io iframe blocks 🧠 Aligned to TRM Reanga principles and kaupapa-based design standards 🔒 Licensed under the Te Reo Makitaunu proprietary framework

⚙️ Installation & Hosting

Option 1 – GitHub Pages (recommended)

Create a new public repository on GitHub.

Upload all exported files (index.html, /assets, or compiled /dist folder).

Go to Settings → Pages → Source → main branch → /root → Save.

Your project will be live at:

https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
Option 2 – Systeme.io

Upload the exported HTML directly into a Systeme.io custom code block.
Ensure all relative asset paths remain consistent.
Test responsiveness and interactivity inside Systeme.io preview.
📜 Notes

The original .tsx file may be compiled using Vite or React build tools before deployment.
For best compatibility, re-export from Claude as a single self-contained HTML file.
